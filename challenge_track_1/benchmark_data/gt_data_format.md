We provide ground truth instance masks for the development scenes in this folder. Each GT file is a single `{SCENE_ID}.txt` file in which every line corresponds to the instance ID (0 if background - 1,2,3,... for different object instances) of a given point, in the original vertex ordering of the 3D mesh. Please note that submission of the predicted masks require a different file format, explained in more detail [here](https://opensun3d.github.io/cvpr24-challenge/track_1/#submission-instructions).
